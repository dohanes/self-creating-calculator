This is most likely the worst thing I've ever created in my life. Enjoy

Somewhat inspired by [this glorious repository](https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py), this is pretty much just a modular version

## Installation (please don't)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dohanes/self-creating-calculator.git
cd self-creating-calculator
npm install
npm start
```
